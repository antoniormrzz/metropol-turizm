# metropol-turizm
This is a placeholder temporary website. Not much to see here, except a tailwind 2, webpack, postcss, sass and typescript setup.

# Requirements
tailwindcss intellisense for vs code

# Notes
Modules need to include html and ts files with the same name. otherwise webpack will not recognize them. You can import other files inside these 3 files.
